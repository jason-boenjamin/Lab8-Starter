In your README.md, please add a short paragraph answering the question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related? (Answer this after doing the part below)

Graceful degradation and service workers are related in the fact that they both try to ensure a web application's functionality and that the user's experience is still good and reliable. (Especially under less-than-ideal conditions). Graceful degradation is designing a web application to work at a high level with modern features and technologies while ensuring that the application can still operate with reduced functionality on older browsers. This checks off the 'accessibility' on the Software engineering list since users on less capable devices can still access and use the application's core features. 

On the other hand, service workers play an integral role by enhancing the performance and robustness of web applications. Service workers run independently of the main web page and can manage caching, intercept network requests, and provide offline capabilities. This also checks off the 'accessibility' on the Software engineering list by allowing users with slow connection or no connection at all to use the application, aligning with the fundamentals of graceful degradation.

In conclusion, service workers add to graceful degradation by providing a fallback mechanism for network requests and enhancing application performance and resilience. This ensures that users can still access essential functionalities under numerous suboptimal conditions.
